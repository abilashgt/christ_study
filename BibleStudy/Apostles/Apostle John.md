Life:

Overview

- Partaker of tribulations  
- John is writing what he has seen, heard and felt  
  - What was **from the beginning**, what we have **heard**, what we have **seen** with our eyes, what we beheld and **touched with our hands**, concerning the Word of Life— and the life was manifested, and we have **seen** and **bear witness** and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us— what we have **seen** and **heard** we proclaim to you also, so that you may also have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.  
  - — 1 John 1:1-3

Witness

- Grace and Truth  
- And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.  
- — John 1:14  
- This is the disciple who is bearing witness to these things and wrote these things, and we know that his witness is true.  
- — John 21:24

Obedience

- Truth proclaimed by John  
  - Therefore Pilate said to Him, “So You are a king?” Jesus answered, “You yourself said I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.”  
  - — John 18:37

- Love and Obedience  
  - “If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.  
  - — John 14:15  
  - He who has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will disclose Myself to him.”  
  - — John 14:21

Theology in thinking:

- Disciple whom Jesus loved  
  - Initial conclusion, but  
    - Though Jesus loved John the most  
- Conclusion and deciding verse  
  - We love, because He first loved us.  
  - — 1 John 4:19  
  - Now before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus knowing that His hour had come that He would depart out of this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end.  
  - — John 13:1  
  - Love characterised his love and his teaching

Theology in Practice \- 3 acts of Love

- Love received   
  - There was reclining on Jesus’ bosom one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved. So Simon Peter gestured to him to inquire, “Who is the one of whom He is speaking?” He, leaning back thus on Jesus’ bosom, said to Him, “Lord, who is it?” Jesus answered, “He is the one for whom I shall dip the piece of bread and give it to him.” So when He had dipped the piece of bread, He took and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.  
  - — John 13:23-26  
- Love given   
  - Therefore the soldiers did these things. 	But standing by the cross of Jesus were His mother, and His mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus then saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He said to His mother, “Woman, behold, your son\!” Then He said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother\!” From that hour the disciple took her into his home. — John 19:25-27  
    - Those love keep commmandments  
    - We return love because he first loved us  
- Love exceeds  
  - Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came early to the tomb, while it was still dark, and saw the stone already taken away from the tomb. So she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him.” So Peter and the other disciple went forth, and they were going to the tomb. And the two were running together; and the other disciple ran ahead faster than Peter and came to the tomb first;  
  - — John 20:1-4  
- Love Recognized first  
  - Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord.” So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put his outer garment on (for he was stripped for work), and cast himself into the sea.  
  - — John 21:7  
- Love Follows Implicitly  
  - Now this He said, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He said to him, “Follow Me\!” 	Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them; the one who also had leaned back on His bosom at the supper and said, “Lord, who is the one who betrays You?”  
  - — John 21:19-20  
  - Peter was given the command but John was already following

Conclusion:

- Borrowing from Paul  
  - so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being firmly rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.  
  - — Ephesians 3:17-19

Background

Character:

Despite his reputation as “the apostle of love,” John had a fiery temperament. Jesus named John and James “Sons of Thunder” (Mark 3:17), and the two brothers lived up to that name. Indignant when a Samaritan village refused to receive Jesus and the disciples, and overestimating their apostolic power, they eagerly asked the Lord, “Do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?” (Luke 9:54). In the only place recorded in the Synoptic Gospels where John acted and spoke alone, he reveals the same attitude, saying to Jesus, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name; and we tried to prevent him because he does not follow along with us” (Luke 9:49).

Though he mellowed toward people over time (I trace the development of his spiritual character in my book *Twelve Ordinary Men* \[Nashville: W Publishing Group, 2002\]), John never lost his passion for the truth. Two vignettes from his years at Ephesus reveal that. According to Polycarp, “John, the disciple of the Lord, going to bathe at Ephesus, and perceiving \[the heretic\] Cerinthus within, rushed out of the bath-house without bathing, exclaiming, ‘Let us fly, lest even the bath-house fall down, because Cerinthus, the enemy of the truth, is within’” (Irenaeus, *Against Heresies,* 3.3.4). Clement of Alexandria relates how John fearlessly entered the camp of a band of robbers whose captain had once professed faith in Christ and led him to true repentance (*Who Is the Rich Man That Shall Be Saved?,* 42).

John’s Gospel

John is the only one of the gospels that contains a precise statement of the author’s purpose: “But these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you may have life in His name” (20:31). John’s objective was both apologetic (“that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God”) and evangelistic (“and that believing you may have life in His name”)

Definition

who:

And going on from there He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and He called them. And immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him.  
— Matthew 4:21-22

But when Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Go away from me Lord, for I am a sinful man\!” For amazement had seized him and all his companions because of the catch of fish which they had taken, and James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon, were also likewise amazed. And Jesus said to Simon, “Do not fear, from now on you will be catching men.” And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed Him.  
— Luke 5:8-11

Now as they observed the confidence of Peter and John and comprehended that they were uneducated and ordinary men, they were marveling, and began to recognize them as having been with Jesus.  
— Acts 4:13

Titles:

and James, the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James (to them He gave the name Boanerges, which means, “Sons of Thunder”);  
— Mark 3:17

and recognizing the grace that had been given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, so that we might go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.  
— Galatians 2:9

The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show to His slaves the things which must soon happen; and He indicated this by sending it through His angel to His slave John, who bore witness to the word of God and to the witness of Jesus Christ, even to all that he saw.  
— Revelation 1:1-2

- slave and witness

I, John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance which are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the witness of Jesus.  
— Revelation 1:9

I, John, am the one who was hearing and seeing these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed me these things. But he said to me, “Do not do that\! I am a fellow slave with you and your brothers the prophets and with those who keep the words of this book. Worship God\!”  
— Revelation 22:8-9

Inner circle of Jesus:

And six days later, Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John, and brought them up on a high mountain alone by themselves. And He was transfigured before them;  
— Mark 9:2

Now it happened some eight days after these words, that taking along Peter and John and James, He went up on the mountain to pray. And it happened that while He was praying, the appearance of His face became different, and His clothing became white and gleaming.  
— Luke 9:28-29

While he was saying this, a cloud formed and began to overshadow them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.  
— Luke 9:34

And as He was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew were questioning Him privately, “Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when all these things are going to be fulfilled?” And Jesus began to say to them, “See to it that no one deceives you.  
— Mark 13:3-5

So when He came to the house, He did not allow anyone to enter with Him, except Peter and John and James, and the girl’s father and mother.  
— Luke 8:51

Mistakes:

Then James and John, the two sons of Zebedee, came up to Jesus, saying to Him, “Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask of You.” And He said to them, “What do you want Me to do for you?” And they said to Him, “Grant that we may sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your glory.” But Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?” And they said to Him, “We are able.” And Jesus said to them, “The cup that I drink you shall drink; and you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized. But to sit on My right or on My left, this is not Mine to give; but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.” 	And hearing this, the ten began to feel indignant with James and John. And calling them to Himself, Jesus said to them, “You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great men exercise authority over them. But it is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant; and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.”  
— Mark 10:35-45

Church:

And when they had entered the city, they went up to the upper room where they were staying; that is, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James. These all with one accord were continually devoting themselves to prayer, along with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and His brothers.  
— Acts 1:13-14

Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the ninth hour, the hour of prayer.  
— Acts 3:1

But Peter said, “I do not possess silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene—walk\!” And seizing him by the right hand, he raised him up; and immediately his feet and his ankles were strengthened.  
— Acts 3:6-7

But Peter and John answered and said to them, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to hear you rather than God, you be the judge; for we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard.” And when they had threatened them further, they let them go (finding no basis on which to punish them) on account of the people, because they were all glorifying God for what had happened; for the man was more than forty years old on whom this sign of healing had occurred.  
— Acts 4:19-22

Love of John the apostle:

So Simon Peter gestured to him to inquire, “Who is the one of whom He is speaking?” He, leaning back thus on Jesus’ bosom, said to Him, “Lord, who is it?” Jesus answered, “He is the one for whom I shall dip the piece of bread and give it to him.” So when He had dipped the piece of bread, He took and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. And after the piece of bread, Satan then entered into him. Therefore Jesus said to him, “What you do, do quickly.” Now no one of those reclining at the table knew for what purpose He had said this to him.  
— John 13:24-28

Ministry:

When Jesus then saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He said to His mother, “Woman, behold, your son\!” Then He said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother\!” From that hour the disciple took her into his home.  
— John 19:26-27

Fellowship through God’s word:

- portal to the ultimate dimension   
- To the heart of God

For when He received honor and glory from God the Father, such an utterance as this was made to Him by the Majestic Glory, “This is My beloved Son with whom I am well-pleased”— and we ourselves heard this utterance made from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain. 	And we have as more sure the prophetic word, to which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your hearts. Know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes by one’s own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever made by the will of man, but men being moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.  
— 2 Peter 1:17-21

And He said to them, “O foolish ones and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken\! Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?” Then beginning with Moses and with all the prophets, He interpreted to them the things concerning Himself in all the Scriptures.  
— Luke 24:25-27

And it happened that when He had reclined at the table with them, He took the bread and blessed it, and after breaking it, He was giving it to them. Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Him. And He vanished from their sight. And they said to one another, “Were not our hearts burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, while He was opening the Scriptures to us?” And they stood up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and found gathered together the eleven and those with them, who were saying, “The Lord has really risen and has appeared to Simon.”  
— Luke 24:30-34

Deception:

And Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, “From any tree of the garden you may surely eat; but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat from it; for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die.”  
— Genesis 2:16-17

And the woman said to the serpent, “From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; but from the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God said, ‘You shall not eat from it, and you shall not touch it, lest you die.’”  
— Genesis 3:2-3

“And the one also who had received the one talent came up and said, ‘Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you scattered no seed. And I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have what is yours.’ 	“But his master answered and said to him, ‘You wicked, lazy slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I scattered no seed.  
— Matthew 25:24-26

Conclusions:

For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, that He would give you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being firmly rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.  
— Ephesians 3:14-19

Blockers:

Does God owe us Grace?

1. First, I am amazed by it.  
2. Second we not surprised   
3. Third or fourth we begin to expect it.  
4. Then we assume it  
5. Then we demand it  
6. Finally we get angry if we don’t get it.

Greatest distortion in our thinking is that God owes us mercy.

- God is somehow obligated

A warning bell should go up.

Grace by definition is voluntary 

- God is not required
