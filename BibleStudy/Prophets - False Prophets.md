# False Prophets

## Verses

“If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you and gives you a sign or a wonder, and the sign or the wonder comes true, concerning which he spoke to you, saying, ‘Let us go after other gods (whom you have not known) and let us serve them,’ you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams; for the Lord your God is testing you to find out if you love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. You shall follow the Lord your God and fear Him; and you shall keep His commandments, listen to His voice, serve Him, and cling to Him. But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he has counseled rebellion against the Lord your God who brought you from the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery, to seduce you from the way in which the Lord your God commanded you to walk. So you shall purge the evil from among you.   
— Deuteronomy 13:1-5

“I will raise up a prophet from among their countrymen like you, and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him. It shall come about that whoever will not listen to My words which he shall speak in My name, I Myself will require it of him. But the prophet who speaks a word presumptuously in My name which I have not commanded him to speak, or which he speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet shall die.’ You may say in your heart, ‘How will we know the word which the Lord has not spoken?’ When a prophet speaks in the name of the Lord, if the thing does not come about or come true, that is the thing which the Lord has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously; you shall not be afraid of him.”   
— Deuteronomy 18:18-22

“The head is the elder and the highly respected man,  
And the prophet who teaches falsehood is the tail.  
For those who guide this people are leading them astray;  
And those who are guided by them are brought to confusion.”  
— Isaiah 9:15-16

- False prophet

And these also reel with wine and stagger from strong drink:  
The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink;  
They are swallowed up by wine, they stagger from strong drink;  
They reel while having visions;  
They totter when rendering a verdict.  
— Isaiah 28:7

  - Consumed by win or string drink

The priests did not say, ‘Where is Yahweh?’  
And those who handle the law did not know Me;  
The shepherds also transgressed against Me,  
And the prophets prophesied by Baal  
And walked after things that did not profit.  
— Jeremiah 2:8

- false prophets

They have dealt falsely about Yahweh  
And said, “Not He;  
Calamity will not come on us,  
And we will not see sword or famine.  
The prophets are as wind,  
And the word is not in them.  
Thus it will be done to them\!”  
— Jeremiah 5:12-13

“A horrible and appalling thing  
Has happened in the land:  
The prophets prophesy with lying,  
And the priests have dominion by their own hand;  
And My people love it so\!  
But what will you do at the end of it?  
— Jeremiah 5:30-31

“For from the least of them even to the greatest of them,  
Everyone is greedy for gain,  
And from the prophet even to the priest  
Everyone practices lying.  
They have healed the brokenness of My people superficially,  
Saying, ‘Peace, peace,’  
But there is no peace.  
— Jeremiah 6:13-14

- False healing

Therefore I will give their wives to others,  
Their fields to new possessors,  
Because from the least even to the greatest  
Everyone is greedy for gain;  
From the prophet even to the priest  
Everyone practices lying.  
— Jeremiah 8:10

But, “Ah, Lord Yahweh\!” I said, “Behold, the prophets are saying to them, ‘You will not see the sword nor will you have famine, but I will give you true peace in this place.’” Then Yahweh said to me, “The prophets are prophesying lies in My name. I have neither sent them nor commanded them nor spoken to them; they are prophesying to you a vision of lies, divination, futility, and the deception of their own hearts. Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets who are prophesying in My name, although it was not I who sent them—yet they keep saying, ‘There will be no sword or famine in this land’—by that sword and famine those prophets shall meet their end\! The people also to whom they are prophesying will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and there will be no one to bury them—neither them, nor their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters—for I will pour out their own evil on them.   
And you will say this word to them,  
‘Let my eyes flow down with tears night and day,  
And let them not cease,  
For the virgin daughter of my people has been shattered with a mighty shattering,  
With a sorely sick wound.  
If I go out to the field,  
Behold, those slain with the sword\!  
Or if I enter the city,  
Behold, diseases of famine\!  
For both prophet and priest  
Have gone around as merchants in the land that they do not know.’”  
— Jeremiah 14:13-18

“As for the prophets:  
My heart is broken within me;  
All my bones tremble;  
I have become like a drunken man,  
Even like a man overcome with wine,  
Because of Yahweh  
And because of His holy words.  
For the land is full of adulterers;  
For the land mourns because of the curse.  
The pastures of the wilderness have dried up.  
Their course also is evil,  
And their might is not right.  
“For both prophet and priest are polluted;  
Even in My house I have found their evil,” declares Yahweh.  
“Therefore their way will be like slippery paths to them;  
They will be driven away into the thick darkness and fall down in it;  
For I will bring their evil upon them,  
The year of their punishment,” declares Yahweh.  
	  
“Moreover, among the prophets of Samaria I saw an offensive thing:  
They prophesied by Baal and led My people Israel astray.  
Also among the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen an appalling thing:  
The committing of adultery and walking in lying;  
And they strengthen the hands of evildoers,  
So that no one has turned back from his evil.  
All of them have become to Me like Sodom,  
And her inhabitants like Gomorrah.  
Therefore thus says Yahweh of hosts concerning the prophets,  
‘Behold, I am going to feed them wormwood  
And make them drink poisoned water,  
For from the prophets of Jerusalem  
Pollution has gone forth into all the land.’”  
	Thus says Yahweh of hosts,  
“Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are prophesying to you.  
They are leading you into vanity;  
They speak a vision of their own heart,  
Not from the mouth of Yahweh.  
They keep saying to those who spurn Me,  
‘Yahweh has said, “You will have peace”’;  
And as for everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart,  
They say, ‘Evil will not come upon you.’  
But who has stood in the council of Yahweh,  
That he should see and hear His word?  
Who has given heed to His word and heard?  
Behold, the storm of Yahweh has gone forth in wrath,  
Even a whirling storm;  
It will whirl down on the head of the wicked.  
The anger of Yahweh will not turn back  
Until He has done and established the purposes of His heart;  
In the last days you will clearly understand it.  
I did not send these prophets,  
But they ran.  
I did not speak to them,  
But they prophesied.  
But if they had stood in My council,  
Then they would have caused My words to be heard by My people  
And would have turned them back from their evil way  
And from the evil of their deeds.  
	  
“Am I a God who is near,” declares Yahweh,  
“And not a God far off?  
Can a man hide himself in hiding places  
So I do not see him?” declares Yahweh.  
“Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?” declares Yahweh.  
	“I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy a lie in My name, saying, ‘I had a dream, I had a dream\!’ How long? Is there anything in the hearts of the prophets who prophesy a lie, even these prophets of the deception of their own heart, who intend to make My people forget My name by their dreams which they recount to one another, just as their fathers forgot My name because of Baal? The prophet who has a dream may recount his dream, but let him who has My word speak My word in truth. What does straw have in common with grain?” declares Yahweh. “Is not My word like fire?” declares Yahweh, “and like a hammer which shatters a rock? Therefore behold, I am against the prophets,” declares Yahweh, “who steal My words from each other. Behold, I am against the prophets,” declares Yahweh, “who take their tongues and declare, ‘Yahweh declares.’ Behold, I am against those who have prophesied lying dreams,” declares Yahweh, “and who recounted them and led My people astray by their lying and reckless boasting; yet I did not send them, and I did not command them, and they do not furnish this people the slightest benefit,” declares Yahweh. 	“Now when this people or the prophet or a priest asks you, saying, ‘What is the oracle of Yahweh?’ then you shall say to them, ‘What oracle?’ Yahweh declares, ‘I will abandon you.’ Then as for the prophet or the priest or the people who say, ‘The oracle of Yahweh,’ I will bring punishment upon that man and his household. Thus will each of you say to his neighbor and to his brother, ‘What has Yahweh answered?’ or, ‘What has Yahweh spoken?’ For you will no longer remember the oracle of Yahweh because every man’s own word will become the oracle, and you have perverted the words of the living God, Yahweh of hosts, our God. Thus you will say to that prophet, ‘What has Yahweh answered you?’ and, ‘What has Yahweh spoken?’ For if you all say, ‘The oracle of Yahweh\!’ surely thus says Yahweh, ‘Because you said this word, “The oracle of Yahweh\!” I have also sent to you, saying, “You shall not say, ‘The oracle of Yahweh\!’”’ Therefore behold, I will surely forget you and abandon you, along with the city which I gave you and your fathers, so that you are out of My presence. I will put an everlasting reproach on you and an everlasting humiliation which will not be forgotten.””  
— Jeremiah 23:9-40

Thus says Yahweh of hosts,  
“Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are prophesying to you.  
They are leading you into vanity;  
They speak a vision of their own heart,  
Not from the mouth of Yahweh.  
— Jeremiah 23:16

I did not send these prophets,  
But they ran.  
I did not speak to them,  
But they prophesied.  
— Jeremiah 23:21

“I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy a lie in My name, saying, ‘I had a dream, I had a dream\!’ How long? Is there anything in the hearts of the prophets who prophesy a lie, even these prophets of the deception of their own heart,  
— Jeremiah 23:25-26

Therefore behold, I am against the prophets,” declares Yahweh, “who steal My words from each other. Behold, I am against the prophets,” declares Yahweh, “who take their tongues and declare, ‘Yahweh declares.’ Behold, I am against those who have prophesied lying dreams,” declares Yahweh, “and who recounted them and led My people astray by their lying and reckless boasting; yet I did not send them, and I did not command them, and they do not furnish this people the slightest benefit,” declares Yahweh.  
— Jeremiah 23:30-32

For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Do not let your prophets who are in your midst and your diviners deceive you, and do not listen to your dreams which you dream. For they prophesy a lie to you in My name; I have not sent them,’ declares Yahweh.  
— Jeremiah 29:8-9

O Israel, your prophets have been like foxes among waste places. You have not gone up into the breaches, nor did you build the wall around the house of Israel to stand in the battle on the day of Yahweh. They behold worthlessness and lying divination who are saying, ‘Yahweh declares,’ when Yahweh has not sent them; yet they wait for the establishing of their word. Did you not see a worthless vision and speak a lying divination when you said, ‘Yahweh declares,’ but it is not I who have spoken?”’” 	Therefore, thus says Lord Yahweh, “Because you have spoken worthlessness and beheld a lie, therefore behold, I am against you,” declares Lord Yahweh. “So My hand will be against the prophets who see worthless visions and utter lying divinations. They will not be in the council of My people, nor will they be written down in the register of the house of Israel, nor will they enter the land of Israel, that you may know that I am Lord Yahweh.  
— Ezekiel 13:4-9 lsb
